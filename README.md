# ECOAR — RISC-V Assembly Examples

A collection of RISC-V assembly programs for the RARS simulator. Each file is a standalone program that demonstrates a specific concept or algorithm.

## Assembly Programs

- **`3_low_to_cap.asm`**: Reads a string and converts every third lowercase letter to uppercase.
- **`biggest_unsigned_decimal_number.asm`**: Finds the largest unsigned decimal number in a string.
- **`capitalize_from_string.asm`**: Capitalizes characters in the first string if they are present in the second string.
- **`digit_complement.asm`**: Replaces all digits in a string with their complement to 9 (e.g., 0 becomes 9, 1 becomes 8).
- **`flipstring.asm`**: Reverses the order of digits within a string, leaving other characters in place.
- **`longest_string_sequence.asm`**: Finds and prints the longest sequence of consecutive digits in a string.
- **`num_dec_nums.asm`**: Counts the number of decimal numbers in a string.
- **`rem_all_but_first_up.asm`**: Removes all uppercase letters from a string except the first one in a consecutive sequence.
- **`rem_char_prec_dig.asm`**: Removes any character that is preceded by a digit.
- **`remove_char_sequence.asm`**: Removes a sequence of characters from a string between two user-specified indices.
- **`remove_digits.asm`**: Removes all digits from a string.

## Requirements

- A RISC-V simulator, such as RARS.

## Usage

1. Open any `.asm` file in a RISC-V simulator (e.g., RARS).
2. Assemble and run the program using the simulator's controls.
